# 2048-Hexagon-Game
[Link to Game](https://dronom.surge.sh/)

The game is a complicated version of [2048](https://play2048.co/), where hexagons are used instead of squares, and, accordingly, they can move in six directions.

| Direction                 | Keyboard key |
| ------------------------- | :----------: |
| north (top)               |      w       |
| north-east (top-right)    |      e       |
| north-west (top-left)     |      q       |
| south (bottom)            |      s       |
| south-east (bottom-right) |      d       |
| south-west (bottom-left)  |      a       |

The Game requires a hostname (you can leave the default) and a radius. The radius is responsible for the size of the map. The current version of the server supports a maximum radius of 6, although the frontend has been written so that it can render a field of any size! (You can experiment and change this value in the url parameters).

### Stack:

The development used ```Typescript, React, redux, react-router-dom, surge for deployment, and other small libraries```.

The task was done as a test task for a company, because of which I can't post the solution in the public access. If you are interested in it, please contact me.
